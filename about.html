        <h2>VISION & MISSION</h2>

        <p>Bioregioning Clyde seeks to ‘Dig From Where We Stand’ to get to the heart of what matters to people living and working here. We seek to work as a conduit between grass roots projects and higher level national and regional policies, cutting across political boundaries and practicing at a functional regional scale. There is no other entity practicing in this way at this landscape scale. This is the optimum time to build on existing synergies and practices, to learn together, and to support our good practices in the context of the climate and nature emergency and at a time when people need inspiration, collaboration and shared experiences (ICE) to build new levels of adaptive resilience going forward.</p>

        <h2>WHAT IS BIOREGION</h2>
        <p>In The Bioregional Economy, Molly Scott Cato use the definition by Robert Thayer, that:
            ‘A bioregion is literally and etymologically a ‘life-place’ – a unique region defined by natural (rather than political) boundaries with geographic, climatic, hydrological and ecological character capable of supporting unique human and non-human living communities. Bioregions can be variously defined by the geography of watersheds, similar plant and animal ecosystems, and related identifiable landforms and by unique human cultures that grow from natural limits and potentials of the region’
            
            A fuller definition from the World Resources Institute also notes the importance of the geo-political dimensions of bioregioning:
            ‘Within this ecological and social framework, governmental, community, corporate, and other private interests share responsiblity for coordinating land-use planning for both public and private land and for defining and implementing development options that will ensure that human needs are met in a sustainable way. Innovative forms of institutional integration and social cooperation are needed to meet these needs. Dialogue among all interests, participatory planning, and great institutional flexibility are essential.’
            
            John Thackera evokes the importance of grassroots action, stating 
            ‘understanding that caring for the health of a place and persons who inhabit it are part of one story. With this care for place as their frame, communities are connecting the ‘what is’, with the ‘what if?’ across a range of activities…’

        <h2>WHAT IS BIOREGIONING</h2>
        <p>The Clyde Bioregion comprises a complex system of entangled human and more-than-human communities, a living landscape of dynamic inter-relationships, forces and pressures for change, realities and perceptions.  But the process of bioregioning may be more akin to the tasks of care and kindness, developing a range of sensibilities and sensitivities, attentiveness to and respect for all kin within a shared bioregion.

            Bioregioning recognises the significant problems we face, often relating to generational and landscape injustices, and that in some cases finding solutions will require systems change.  Identifying and understanding the ‘problems’ and how they manifest specifically in the Clyde Bioregion is an important part of the process, whether these relate to over exploitation of marine fisheries, diffuse pollution, soil loss, food poverty, colonial legacies, discrimination, the climate crisis or so many other social and ecological challenges we currently face.  One way we are framing this is trying to think in terms of ‘shifting the conditions that hold the problem in place’ : a phrase formulated by Social Innovation Canada.
